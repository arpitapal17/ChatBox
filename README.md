This project is a simple and interactive chatbox application built using MongoDB and Express.js. The application allows users to interact with a chatbot, enabling them to add, edit, delete, and fetch chat messages in real-time. It demonstrates the integration of a NoSQL database with a Node.js server to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations effectively.

Features
Add Messages: Users can send new chat messages that are stored in a MongoDB collection.
Edit Messages: Users have the ability to update previously sent messages.
Delete Messages: Users can delete specific messages, ensuring that only relevant conversations are kept.

Technology Stack
Backend:
Node.js: The core runtime environment used to execute the server-side code.
Express.js: A lightweight web application framework for Node.js used to build the RESTful API.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing chat messages in a document-oriented format.
Frontend:
Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript to interact with the Express.js server and display chat messages dynamically.
